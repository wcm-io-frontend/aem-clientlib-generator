Integration Test: wcmio-archetype
=================================

Maven-based Integration test derived from the type of frontend setup generated by [wcm.io Maven Archetype for AEM](https://wcm.io/tooling/maven/archetypes/aem/) 3.x.

It uses `aem-clientlib-generator` directly from this project as file references in package.json.

The generated client libraries in the `result` folder are compared against a predefined `existing-result` folder, with a diff-compare after as part of the integration test run.
